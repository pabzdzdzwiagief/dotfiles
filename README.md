pabżdźdźwiągief's configuration files.

The purpose of these configuration files is to establish a fairly usable
Unix environment that consists specifically of the following programs:

- emacs,
- i3,
- nitrogen,
- dmenu,
- urxvt,
- tmux,
- zsh.

There is also a bunch of somewhat trivial, but ocasionally useful scripts.
